# Personal Task Tracker - Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

The user wants to build a personal task tracking web application with the following key requirements:
- Track different types of tasks (H=Hard Line, M=Main Line, S=Soft Line) across weekly periods
- Calculate completion percentages and streaks for each task
- Display tasks in a weekly calendar view (Monday-Sunday)
- PWA support for Android installation
- Simple username/password authentication
- Cross-platform data synchronization (laptop + phone)
- Real-time or near real-time data updates
- Public hosting capability with secure authentication
- Task management (add/edit/delete) with weekly planning cycles
- Historical data access for long-term usage

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Technical Architecture Challenges:
1. **Cross-platform data sync**: Need a backend database that can be accessed from multiple devices
2. **PWA implementation**: Requires service worker, manifest file, and responsive design
3. **Authentication security**: Must hash passwords since app will be publicly hosted
4. **Streak calculation**: Complex logic to calculate consecutive days across multiple weeks
5. **Real-time updates**: Need efficient data synchronization between devices
6. **Free hosting constraints**: Must choose technologies that work with free hosting platforms

### Data Model Complexity:
1. **Task persistence across weeks**: Tasks can span multiple weeks while maintaining streaks
2. **Weekly task management**: Users set up tasks per week but want streak continuity
3. **Completion tracking**: Need to track daily completions for percentage and streak calculations
4. **Historical data**: Long-term storage and efficient querying for historical views

### UX/UI Considerations:
1. **Mobile-first design**: Must work well on both desktop and mobile
2. **Visual feedback**: Color coding for completed tasks and visual streak indicators
3. **Week navigation**: Intuitive navigation between weeks
4. **Task prioritization**: Visual hierarchy (H > M > S tasks)

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

**🔧 ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES RESOLVED - TESTING CONNECTION 🔧**

**Problem Resolution Progress:**
- ✅ **Environment variables found**: User has `.env.local` file with correct Supabase credentials
- ✅ **Variable format correct**: REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL and REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY properly set
- ✅ **URLs valid**: Supabase URL format correct (https://qhqiywrtwmtufifujqhj.supabase.co)
- ✅ **Dev server started**: `npm start` running (not `npm run dev` - script name was wrong)
- 🧪 **Testing database connection**: Need to verify if Supabase database is accessible

**Technical Details Found:**
- Supabase URL: `https://qhqiywrtwmtufifujqhj.supabase.co`
- Anon key: Valid JWT token format
- App running on: `http://localhost:3000`
- Database test function available: `dbUtils.testConnection()`

**Next Testing Steps:**
1. ✅ Environment variables confirmed working
2. 🧪 Test database connection via browser console
3. 🧪 Test task creation in UI
4. 🧪 Check browser console for any errors during task creation

**Possible Remaining Issues:**
- Database schema might not be set up in Supabase
- RLS (Row Level Security) policies not configured
- Tables (`tasks`, `users`, `task_completions`) might not exist

**Status:** 🟡 TESTING - Environment variables resolved, testing database connection

**Instructions for User:**
1. Open browser at http://localhost:3000
2. Open developer console (F12)
3. Test database connection manually
4. Attempt to add a task and report any errors

## Lessons

### User Specified Lessons:
- Include info useful for debugging in the program output
- Read the file before you try to edit it
- If there are vulnerabilities that appear in the terminal, run npm audit before proceeding
- Always ask before using the -force git command

### Project-Specific Lessons:
- **Tailwind CSS version compatibility**: Newer versions of Tailwind CSS (3.4+) have PostCSS plugin issues with Create React App. Use Tailwind CSS 3.3.0 for compatibility.
- **PowerShell execution policy**: Windows PowerShell execution policy blocks npm global packages like Vercel CLI. Alternative: use GitHub + Vercel web interface for deployment.
